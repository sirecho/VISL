      <p>Most students like the freedom they have in college. Usually college students live on their own, in the dormitory or in an apartment. This means they are free to come and go as they like. Their parents cannot tell them when to get up, when to go to school, and when to come home. It also means that they are free to wear what they want. There are no parents to comment about their hair styles or their dirty jeans. Finally, they are free to listen to their favorite music without interference from parents.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; background-color: pink; color: white">Three important Swiss customs for tourists to know deal with religion, greeting, and punctuality. The Swiss people are very religious, and Sunday is their holy day. On Sunday, people rarely work in the garden, in the house, or even on the car. Foreign tourists should know that the most drugstores, supermarkets, and banks are closed on Sunday.</p>
      <p style="text-align: right">The Swiss are also a formal people. For example, they seldom call acquaintances by their first names; the German Herr and French Monsieur are much more frequently used in Switzerland than the English Mister is used in the United States. A tourist should therefore say either Herr or Monsieur when greeting an acquaintance, and only use the person's first name if he is a close friend.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center">In addition, Switzerland is the land of watches and exactness. It is important to be on time to parties, business, meetings, and churches because Swiss hosts, factory bosses, and ministers all love punctuality. It is especially important for tourists to be on time for trains: Swiss train conductors never wait for late arrivers. (summary sentence) In summary, Swiss customs are very easy to follow and very important to remember!</p>
